# Music-app
Spotify Clone or Simple music app
This is a music streaming app very similar to Spotify using the MVVM Architecture. In this project, i  used Flutter for the app's frontend, FastAPI for the backend, PostgreSQL for the database, Hive for local data storage and Riverpod (Generators) for state management.
